My name is Jamie Davis, and I'm a software developer from the UK, living in Essex, near London.

### More Information

I've been a professional developer since 1986, although we didn't say "Developer" in those days. At 18, I started my career programming mainframes in assembly language, which raised eyebrows even back then. However, programming for me had started as a hobby when I was 13. I had decided that I wanted to be a programmer, and my parents pushed the boat out and gave me a ZX Spectrum as a gift. I started coding then, and I'm still going. (Thanks Mum & Dad.)

Programming has been a lifelong learning experience for me. If it wasn't that way I would probably have stopped a long time ago, but I still have the love of making things out of code that I had at 13. I'm not sure if that says something good or bad about me, but it is what it is.
